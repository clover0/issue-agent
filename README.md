---


The Issue Agent is a tool that generates work products in a Git repository based on a given assignment.

Powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), 
this agent is designed to help developers efficiently tackle simple issues. 
When a developer creates an issue in a repository and assigns it to this agent, 
it autonomously works to solve the issue and submits the results as a Pull Request on GitHub.
